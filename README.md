# SpeedScan
Upload your PDF document, and SpeedScan processes the text
by applying an innovative speed reading technique that emphasizes specific parts
of words as your main focal points during reading. Instead of fixating on reading
each word in its entirety, SpeedScan directs your focus to key segments, allowing
for quicker information absorption and improved reading efficiency. This proven
method has been shown to accelerate reading speed and comprehension.


# Features
Allows users to upload a pdf on click or drag-and-drop. The program processes the file and outputs a new edited pdf named "speedscanned" to the user
which contains the text from their original inputted pdf but with a reading technique applied.
